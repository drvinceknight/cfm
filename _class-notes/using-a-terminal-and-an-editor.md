# First meeting

After this meeting students should:

- Understand the basic idea of using a cli and an editor

Explain that there is no specific class problem today as there is no new python
concept to cover.

- Open a terminal an macOS and explain the use of Anaconda Prompt on Windows.
- Navigate to `cfm` describing the difference in commands when appropriate on
  Windows.
- Open a Python REPL.

Now open VScode (show how to install), create a file and put it in the folder.
Run it.

# After class communication

Send the following email after class::

    Hi all,

    A recording of today's class is available at <>.

    In this class I went over using the command line and an editor.

    In preparation for your tutorial tomorrow please work through the tenth
    chapter of the Python for mathematics book:
    https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/04-editor-and-cli/introduction/main.html

    A reminder that tomorrow is your last tutorial.

    Please get in touch if I can assist with anything,
    Vince
