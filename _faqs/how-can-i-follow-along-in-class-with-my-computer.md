title: How can I follow along in class with my computer?
---

Just like in any other mathematics class, if you would like to try and follow
along with the various steps we do in class: I recommend that you do.

If at some point you no longer are able to follow, make a note, perhaps skip
where you are and continue to follow along or just continue to make notes.
