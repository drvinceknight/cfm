title: Why do we use Jupyter notebooks?
---

Using Jupyter notebooks is a common approach when **using** python as opposed to developing tools in python.
You can see a longer explanation of this here: https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/why/main.html#why-use-jupyter

We will be using Python through a different interface in the Spring Semester.

I hope that through this course you gain an appreciation for different ways to use Python and become adapt at choosing the best one for the
particular task you are undertaking.
