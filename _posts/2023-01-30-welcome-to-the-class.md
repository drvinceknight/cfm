This is a brief message before our first class.

All of the course materials (including short videos) are available at
https://vknight.org/cfm/.

During the class I will use a virtual whiteboard, if you want to you can
access the whiteboard on your own device here: [microsoft whiteboard link](https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:wb:/g/personal/knightva_cardiff_ac_uk/ETDexlIXeMVAm5eiqkJ1rPYBdRvHll8io8U7WMlgx-KS0w?e=06TWE1)

I will be using the School discord server to duplicate class communication.
If you have not joined the School discord server and would like to please check
your emails where you will find a duplicate version of this message with an
email invitation.

Thanks :)
