This is a brief message before our first class.

All of the course materials (including short videos) are available at
[https://vknight.org/cfm/](https://vknight.org/cfm/)

I will be using the School discord server to duplicate class communication.
If you have not joined the School discord server and would like to please check
your emails for an invitation (or let me know).

Thanks :)
