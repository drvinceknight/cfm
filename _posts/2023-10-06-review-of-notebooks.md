In class today we covered the usage of notebooks.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ceaa732d-90b0-4974-8905-b08e00c65308)

We started by doing a quiz (I'll be doing these every week -- more about this
later) where we went over:

- The programming language we are using in this module: Python.
- What a markup language is: a tool to write content and describe how it is to be
  displayed at the same time. This week we saw some basic usage of Markdown and
  LaTeX
- What distribution of Python we are using: the Anaconda distribution which
  includes not only Python but a number of useful libraries for mathematics.
- What interface we are using to Python: the Jupyter notebook interface.

Next week we will be starting to do some symbolic algebra, if you are interested
you can start reading about it [here](https://vknight.org/cfm/topics/algebra.html)

### Regarding the quiz

On my way to class this morning I thought I could offer a prize of a text book
to the winner of the quiz. I cannot do that every week so instead I will keep
track of who wins every week (I'll do a quiz like this every week) and the
overall leader can pick a text book.

The overall leader will be decided by **total number of winning weeks** (and not
total points).
Congrats to Ben who has 1 win after this week.
