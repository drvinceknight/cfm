In class today we reviewed the concepts from the Algebra chapter.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3f4f4eee-cd22-4233-84a4-b09500c65282)

We started off with the quiz reviewing a number of concepts and I'm really sorry
I messed up the last question. I declared Cian (who was leading at the
penultimate question) the winner **however** I got my to my desk and input the
correct answer in the slide, mentimeter was able to redo the results (I should
have just done this in class) and in fact **Joe** won! So Joe and
Ben lead the quiz with 1 win each.

In class today we ended up discussing a number of things as you all asked great
questions:

- We spoke about code conventions and how `sympy.Equation` uses a capital `E`
  because it follows the convention for **creating** a thing/object. This
  differs from `sympy.solveset` (which uses a small `s`) because this **does**
  something.
- We also talked a bit about different types of errors, for example a `NameError`
  is Python telling you that it does not know what something is. A `SyntaxError`
  is Python telling you that you're not writing Python.
- We talked about what the Python Kernel actually is. There is a chapter of
  Python for Mathematics that goes over this: [Kernels](https://vknight.org/pfm/further-information/03-kernel/introduction/main.html)
  if anyone is interested in understanding this further.

One thing I did not think we had time to do was cover the _coursework like
exercise from the handout_. Do attempt to do that (as well as all the other
practice exercises available to you) and I'll happily find time for us to go
over it together.
