In class today we discussed mid module feedback and reviewed the concepts from the Calculus chapter.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5a7666ee-4cd3-4c03-bfbc-b09c00a56a4a)

### Mid module feedback

We started the class by discussing the mid module feedback. A number of you
wrote positive and kind things about the website and the organisation. Helping
students learn is the part of my job I enjoy the most (by far) so these comments
mean a lot.

Some great comments came up:

- Slow down: I go fast when I'm typing. I hear you. I'm going to try and go
  slower. It is not always easy to ask someone to slow down while they're in
  full flight but know that if anyone tells me to slow down I will.
- Discussing more Python basics: we will. This Semester you are mainly learning
  how to use tools. This is partly so that you can already start using them but
  also to help motivate the second semester during which you will write a tool
  of your own (by learning and using a lot of Python basics).
- Having solutions available: I didn't see this during class but just to
  highlight that all the solutions are already available. Let me know if you are
  unable to find them.
- Being able to download Python for Mathematics as a single large document. This
  is actually already possible but it's a big book so might be a lot to
  download. If you'd like me to send you a copy of the pdf just drop me an email.
- Not being able to actually access the mock coursework (I believe this is
  fixed!).
