In class today I gave an overview of how to use the `itertools` library to solve
combinatorics type problems.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=63c0d3df-4297-4947-9059-b09f00f7d192)

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[algebra.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2023-2024/combinatorics.ipynb)

To solve the following problem:

The digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 are arranged in random order, to form a four-digit
number.

1. How many different four-digit numbers can be formed?
2. How many different four-digit numbers:
   1. Are even.
   2. Are less than 4000.

We did not quite have time to get to the last part, if you do attempt the
question and would like some feedback let me know.

If you have any questions please let me know.
