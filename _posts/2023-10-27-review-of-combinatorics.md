In class today we discussed the concepts from the combinatorics chapter.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5d192a42-a372-4a39-acd1-b0a300950afe)

This week's quiz was won by Millie (who I believe is Tom).

So 5 people have a win:

- Anthony
- Daf
- Ben
- Joe
- Millie

After the quiz I tackled the coursework like question from the handout.

You can see the notebook I used here:
