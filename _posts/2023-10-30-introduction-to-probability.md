In class today I gave an overview of how to use the `random` library to simulate
random event to study probability problems.

You can see a recording of the class [here]()

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[probability.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2023-2024/probability.ipynb)

To solve the following problem:

A delivery company delivers fragile items. If a delivery is on time it is usually because it was rushed.
The probability that an item is delivered on time is 3/4.
The probability that an item is broken given that it arrived on time is 3/10 and if it is late 1/5.

1. What is the probability that an item is late?
2. Given that an item is broken what is the probability that it was on time?

Here is a recording of a summary I recorded during the 2020/2021 academic year: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ii1TeLHrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ii1TeLHrM).
You might find that helpful.

If you have any questions please let me know.
