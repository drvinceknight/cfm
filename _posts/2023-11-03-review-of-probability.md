In class today we discussed the concepts from the probability chapter.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d59e4cb7-d4d7-4cd8-abba-b0aa00c655a6)

This week's quiz was won by Daf who now has 2 wins!

4 people have a single win:

- Anthony
- Daf
- Ben
- Joe
- Millie

After the quiz I tackled the coursework like question from the handout. I did
not quite have time to finish it but I did have enough time to discuss the typos
(that made the text confusing) and also show how to setup the experiment
function.

You can see the notebook I used here:
