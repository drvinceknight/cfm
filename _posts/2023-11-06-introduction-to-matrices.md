In class today I gave an overview of how to use the `sympy` library to study
matrices.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7b987f5e-a8bf-49dc-b162-b0ad01084072)

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[matrices.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2023-2024/matrices.ipynb)

The matrix $A$ is given by $A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & a\\ 2 & a & 1\\ a & 1 & 2 a\end{pmatrix}$

1. Find the determinant of $A$
2. Hence find the values of $a$ for which $A$ is singular.
3. For the following values of $a$, when possible obtain $A ^ {- 1}$
   and confirm the result by computing $AA^{-1}$:

   1. $a = 0$;
   2. $a = 1$;
   3. $a = 2$;
   4. $a = 3$.

Here is a recording of a summary I recorded during the 2020/2021 academic year: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq_2ZYKq904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq_2ZYKq904).
You might find that helpful.

I also showed you where I have now moved my personal teaching notes with plans
on what I expect to do in each class. Note that you are not the target audience
for these (I am) but I hope they're helpful to you in your own note taking.
There are links to each one on the page for each topic and you can find them all
directly here [https://vknight.org/cfm/class-notes/](https://vknight.org/cfm/class-notes/).

If you have any questions please let me know.
