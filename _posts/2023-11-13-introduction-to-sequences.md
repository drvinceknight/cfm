In class today I gave an overview of how to use the recursion
to directly define mathematical sequences.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=da2e3574-a904-47c2-bd15-b0b401084ccc)

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[sequences.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2023-2024/sequences.ipynb)

This was a short class as the only thing I wanted us to achieve this week
is understanding of recursion. Recursion can be used for a number of things (not
just defining sequences directly), if you would like an interesting exercise you
can attempt to use recursion to study the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).
If you do attempt this, feel free to get in touch and I'll happily talk it over
with you (or if there's enough interest, I'll do this in class).
