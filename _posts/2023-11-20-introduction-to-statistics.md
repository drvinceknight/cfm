In class today I gave an overview of how to carry out statistical calculations
using the `statistics` library.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=468e500e-765c-4685-971b-b0bb01085056)

In class I asked you all to input how far away you lived from University and
what mark you expected to average in your first year.

Here is the notebook I used in class (which includes the data from the form):
