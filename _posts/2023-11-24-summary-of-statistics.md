In class today I we went over the Statistics chapter.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=eecef5be-6831-47a7-a0e3-b0bf00c656b6)

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[statistics.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2023-2024/statistics.ipynb)

We started with the quiz which was won by Tom who now also has 2 wins:

- Daf: 2 wins
- Tom: 2 wins
- Anthony: 1 win
- Ben: 1 win
- Joe: 1 win
- Millie: 1 win
- Vincent: 1 win

We spent a good while in class today discussing the individual coursework.
I hope that this was helpful to alleviate any worries you might have.

A brief (and no doubt I'm forgetting things) summary of what we discussed

- The coursework will be available on the Monday of week 10.
- The deadline will be the Wednesday of week 11.
- There will be many opportunities to ask for clarification (I welcome any/all
  questions)
- The coursework is marked using a piece of software called [nbchkr](https://nbchkr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
  As with questions, I welcome any discussion/comment/question about the
  marking.
