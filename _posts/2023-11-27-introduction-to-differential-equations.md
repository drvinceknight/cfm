In class today I gave an overview of how to solve differential equations
using `sympy`.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0616582b-d7a9-4df2-b985-b0c20118d0cb)

We covered the use of `sympy.dsolve`.

Here is the notebook I used in class:
