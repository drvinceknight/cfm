In class today I we did a quiz using all the topics from the first year and we
also did the differential equations coursework like exercise.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7ee58b4d-7beb-4755-b24e-b0c600a56922)

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[differential-equations.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2023-2024/differential-equations.ipynb)

We started with the quiz which was won by Axel:

- Daf: 2 wins
- Tom: 2 wins
- Anthony: 1 win
- Ben: 1 win
- Joe: 1 win
- Millie: 1 win
- Vincent: 1 win
- Axel

So Tom and Daf are welcome to come and get a book from my shelf.

After this we went over the coursework like exercise.
