In class yesterday we took a look at the individual coursework.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7423ff04-a8ed-43cc-815f-b0c901084d3d)

Some points that came up during our discussion include:

- I'd recommend before submitting that you restart and run your entire kernel to
  ensure the code works.
- You should not delete anything in the cells.
- Read the question carefully: if the question asks you to output something,
  make sure you do. If it asks you to create a variable with a specific name
  make sure you do.

After discussing the coursework I went over an example coursework which you can
find [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/assessment/example/assignment.ipynb).

The solution is available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/assessment/example/solution.ipynb)
