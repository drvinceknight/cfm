I am going to be away from Cardiff from Week 5 (starting 26th of February) until Easter.

This does imply some changes to the timetable for the first four weeks of the
Semester. Do check your timetable carefully:

- Week 1:
  - Tuesday 30th of January at 1310 in Law 0.22.
  - Friday 2nd of February at 1310 in Abacws 0.01.
- Week 2:
  - Friday 9th of February at 1000 in Biosci 1.21.
  - Friday 9th of February at 1310 in Abacws 0.01.
- Week 3:
  - Tuesday 13th of February at 1310 in Law 0.22.
  - Friday 16th of February at 1310 in Abacws 0.01.
- Week 4:
  - Friday 23rd of February at 1000 in Biosci 1.21.
  - Friday 23rd of February at 1310 in Abacws 0.01.

The schedule you can see [here]({{site.baseurl}}/) includes
expected progress pointers which will hopefully assist you remain on top of the
work you need to do.

I will be scheduling a virtual support session during my time away from Cardiff
and will be available to meet virtually if I can be helpful.
