In class today we spoke about the coursework.

You can see a recording of this here: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=53ced2ac-b8f5-4b07-9b3a-b10201087ba1](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=53ced2ac-b8f5-4b07-9b3a-b10201087ba1)

Current second year students, Olivia, Lilly and Holly spoke gave their presentation from last year showing their project `appraisal`.

After this we discussed the timetable. And I answered some questions regarding
the coursework.

- **Q: Is there a list of topics that students can view**?
- A: Yes you can find it here: [https://vknight.org/cfm/assessment/#past-group-projects](https://vknight.org/cfm/assessment/#past-group-projects)

- **Q: What will be doing in class**?
- A: We will be working the relevant chapters of [Python for Mathematics](https://vknight.org/pfm/cover.html). We are tackling the _building tools_ section of the course.

- **Q: Are we writing all the code in a Jupyter notebook**?
- A: You can see a list of the files that are expected to be submitted here: [https://vknight.org/cfm/assessment/](https://vknight.org/cfm/assessment/)

- **Q (to the `appraisal` group): How did you work?**
- A [Vince paraphrasing]: We worked together on all the topics, meeting and working together each week
  but also working alone each week.
