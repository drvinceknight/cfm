In this post I will discuss the performance of the class:

- Summarise the overall performance of the class (including the performance on
  the individual coursework);
- Summarise the performance of the class on the group coursework

**Note that at this point in time the marks are provisional and could be scaled
by the Exam board.**

## Overall class performance

A summary of the overall class performance is given here:

```txt
count    235
mean      72.38
std       17.84
min        0
25%       63
50%       74.5
75%       85.25
max      100
```

The average is a bit above the University guidelines which are that the mean class mark
should be within \\(62 \pm \frac{80}{\sqrt{n}}\\) where \\(n\\) is 235 in this class (the
number of students in the class).

## Group class performance

I was incredibly impressed with the work you accomplished this Semester. Some
projects where really innovative and well executed.

Some of the projects were really excellent and went up and above of what was
expected.

I particularly enjoyed a number of discussions I had with groups this Semester.
Some of you clearly put a lot of work in to this work and you should be proud of
overcoming the various hurdles and difficulties.

A summary of the class marks are here:

```txt
count    235
mean      61.02
std       25.61
min        0
25%       39
50%       69
75%       75
max      100
```
