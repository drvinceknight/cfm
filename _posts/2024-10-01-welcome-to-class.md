Thanks all for your presence in class today.

A recording of the class is available [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f6baad1d-6776-4535-a7f1-b1f700f7d30a).

In class today:

- I introduced myself;
- We had a discussion about what programming is and how mathematicians
  can use it (if you're interested a link to the paper on Rhino horn
  is here: [An Evolutionary Game Theoretic Model of Rhino Horn Devaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07640)
- I showed you the class resources which are all here:

The overall goal of this week is to ensure you have the software
needed to take part in the course.

**This week**, you should aim to work through this chapter of the Python for
Mathematics text: [Using notebooks
](https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/introduction/main.html)

NOTE That you do not have to sign up to anything to download the software. If
you're asked you can just skip that part.

If you have any trouble installing the software there is an optional
session in your timetable where you can come and see me to help.

If you have any questions please let me know.
