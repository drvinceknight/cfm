In class today we covered the usage of notebooks.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7e5aa1b4-4ec7-4a13-8c92-b1fa00a5686b)

We started by doing a quiz (congratulations to Micheal, I'll give the person
with the most wins a text book at the end of the Semester)
where we went over:

- The programming language we are using in this module: Python.
- What a markup language is: a tool to write content and describe how it is to be
  displayed at the same time. This week we saw some basic usage of Markdown and
  LaTeX
- What distribution of Python we are using: the Anaconda distribution which
  includes not only Python but a number of useful libraries for mathematics.
- What interface we are using to Python: the Jupyter notebook interface.

After this, I helped a number of students get their systems ready and set up. If
you're still having trouble setting up feel free to get in touch to arrange a
time for me to help you.

Next week we will be starting to do some symbolic algebra, if you are interested
you can start reading about it [here](https://vknight.org/cfm/topics/algebra.html)
