title: "Introduction to algebra with Sympy"

In class today I gave an introduction to using [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) to study algebra.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ef9d5ee7-66b2-4794-9220-b1fe00f7e1d1).
I have just realised that the recording has not captured the screen which is frustrating. You can find the notebook I was writing on (which is the only thing that was on the screen)
here: [algebra.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/algebra.ipynb)

In class I used Sympy to solve the following problem:

1. Rationalise the following expression: \\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3} + 1}\\).
2. Consider the quadratic \\(f(x) = -x ^ 2 + 8 x - 18\\).

   1. Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation $f(x)=0$. What
      does this tell us about the graph of \\(f(x)\\).
   2. By completing the square, confirm that \\((4, -2)\\) is the maximum
      point of \\(f(x)\\).

This is similar to the tutorial in the python for mathematics chapter which is
what we will work through during the lab session tomorrow.

### Problems installing the software

If you are still having trouble getting the software installed then please make
time to meet with me (get in touch and we can find a time).

In the meantime, I suggest you use any of the web services that I recommend for
students using chromebooks: [https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/why/main.html#i-only-have-a-chromebook-how-can-i-use-notebooks](https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/why/main.html#i-only-have-a-chromebook-how-can-i-use-notebooks).
