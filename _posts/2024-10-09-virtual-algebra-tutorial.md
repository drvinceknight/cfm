Today's virtual lab went over the tutorial for the Algebra chapter for [Python
for Mathematics](https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/02-algebra/tutorial/main.html).

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=04157a96-e947-46d5-a54f-b20400ca24ad).

The noisy chat was fantastic so thank you for asking great questions.

You can find the notebook I worked on here [algebra-tutorial.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/algebra-tutorial.ipynb).

**Let me know if there is anything I can do to improve how these lab sessions work for you all.**
