In class today we reviewed the concepts from the Algebra chapter.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d34041bd-0317-4070-b45d-b20100a568dc).

We spoke a bit about how I could improve the lab sessions. I think the main
action point for me was to be more aware of the pace of what is on screen. I'll
aim to get better at that.

We started off with the quiz reviewing a number of concepts and I'm really sorry
I messed up the last question. Matt won this one. Matt and Michael both have one
win.

A few people mentioned the recording of the lab session not working: turns out
that I had set something incorrectly. I believe it is fixed now.

**CODE CLUB**: Code club takes place every Friday at 1600 in 1.04. It's a cool
opportunity to bring programming and mathematics together.
