In class today we discussed how to use Sympy to do differentiation, integration
and take limits.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1465aa88-4971-4f70-875f-b20500f80539)

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[calculus.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/calculus.ipynb)

At the end of class I got a few good questions:

Q: What is the LaTeX code for \\(\pi\\)?
A: `$\pi$`

Q: How do we create capital Greek symbols with sympy?
A: `sympy.Symbol(Phi)` will give \\(\Phi\\)
