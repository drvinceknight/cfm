Today's virtual lab went over the tutorial for the Calculus chapter for [Python
for Mathematics](https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/05-combinations-permutations/introduction/main.html).

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=da250ce4-b404-4ed6-8513-b21200d7c916).

You can find the notebook I worked on here [combinatorics-tutorial.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/combinatorics-tutorial.ipynb).

Note that I have also updated the notebook from the class which you can find
here: [combinatorics.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/combinatorics.ipynb)
