In class today we discussed the concepts from the combinatorics chapter.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=33493084-21f6-4d03-8b9c-b20f0094f62e)

This week's quiz was won by Homelander, so 4 people have won a quiz:

- Homelander
- Hacker
- Matt
- Michael

After the quiz I tackled the coursework like question from the handout as well
as question 4 from the chapter on combinatorics.

You can see the notebook I used here:
