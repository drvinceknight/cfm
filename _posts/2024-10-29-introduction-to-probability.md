In class today I gave an overview of how to use the `random` library to simulate
random event to study probability problems.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=90d8266a-49d4-47b1-aeaa-b21300f7ce7c)

Here is the notebook I used in class:

Here is a recording of a summary I recorded during the 2020/2021 academic year: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ii1TeLHrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ii1TeLHrM).
