Today's virtual lab went over the tutorial for the Probability chapter for [Python
for Mathematics](https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/06-probability/tutorial/main.html).

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c1ba87bd-b2b8-406a-8e75-b21900cc46b7).

You can find the notebook I worked on here [probability-tutorial.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/probability-tutorial.ipynb).

Note that I have also updated the notebook from the class which you can find
here: [probability.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/probability.ipynb)
