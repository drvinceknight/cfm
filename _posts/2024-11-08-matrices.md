This is a brief summary of the 3 classes we have had this week about matrices.

The 3 recordings are available:

- [introduction](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=af280eb5-6fb8-43d8-87e4-b21a010839c6)
- [virtual lab](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=eb068ac0-70be-4ac4-8ee3-b22000c19e6b)
- [review](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2cdaef07-dc0f-4969-b9ea-b21d00a56425)

You can find the three notebooks here:

- [matrices.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/matrices.ipynb)
- [matrices-tutorial.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/matrices-tutorial.ipynb)
- [matrices-review.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/matrices-review.ipynb)

While there is some new mathematical content here for those of you who have not
done much linear algebra before there is little new programming concepts: just
the code needed to compute some of these new values.

I did not have time today in class to go over question 3 from the exercises
though. This might be a problem that you would find useful to further your
understanding of linear algebra.
