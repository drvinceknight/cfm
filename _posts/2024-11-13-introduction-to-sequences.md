In class yesterday I gave an overview of how to use the recursion
to directly define mathematical sequences.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=51f6f1f4-9c75-4c3d-902f-b22101083fff)

Here is the notebook I used in class:
[sequences.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/sequences.ipynb)

An interesting use of recursion when programming is to study 
the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). If
you attempt this and would like me to take a look let me know.
