In class today I gave an overview of how to carry out statistical calculations
using the `statistics` library.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c8093891-50ed-42ea-bb2f-b22801085e34).

In class I asked you all to input how many hours a week you spend studying and
what mark you expected to average in your first year.

Here is the notebook I used in class (which includes the data from the form):
[statistics.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/statistics.ipynb)

You can see a plot showing the relationship (and a line of best fit) for your
data
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/boards/2024-2025/relationship_between_expected_mark_and_study_hours.pdf)

Note that this is with the outlier removed (the poor student who expected to
get a mark of 0 and was nonetheless working 72 hours a day). (The notebook
includes all the analysis we did.)
