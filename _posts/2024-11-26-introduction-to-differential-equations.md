In class today I gave an overview of how to solve differential equations using
sympy.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3b09f35b-e89c-4e92-a956-b22f01084d7b).

Here is the notebook I used in class (which includes the data from the form):
[differential-equations.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/differential-equations.ipynb)

At the end of the class I briefly showed you a python library called [fractpy](https://fractpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/) which was a piece of work that came out
of a group project for this module.
