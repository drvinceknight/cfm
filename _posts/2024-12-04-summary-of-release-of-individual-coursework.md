In class yesterday we took a look at the individual coursework.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=86f2f685-74dc-4055-9e18-b23601084d1c)

Some points that came up during our discussion include:

- I'd recommend before submitting that you restart and run your entire kernel to
  ensure the code works.
- You should not delete anything in the cells.
- Read the question carefully: if the question asks you to output something,
  make sure you do. If it asks you to create a variable with a specific name
  make sure you do.
