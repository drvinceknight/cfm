In class today I went over the mock coursework.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=57ab8e8d-9783-401d-ad3f-b23900a5699e)

The solution to the mock is available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/assessment/mock/solution.ipynb)

### Clarification about wording for question 4b.

Today in class I understood the need for some clarification of the wording for
question 4b. The question is asking you to _output_ the particular solutions which
technically is 2 things (the \\(X(t)\\) and the \\(Y(t)\\)). Please output these
two things as a single tuple (that contains both things). Do not worry if the
output is not compiled with LaTeX (this is to be expected).
