In class today we spoke about the coursework and briefly went over a question
similar to the tutorial question for the variables, conditionals and loops
chapter of Python for Mathematics.

You can see a recording of this [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3808deb0-b6c0-4d7d-8bf7-b27100c66317).

You can find the notebook I wrote here: [variables-conditionals-loops.ipynb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/variables-conditionals-loops.ipynb).

What you should be working on:

- Forming groups of 4: please do this on learning central.
- Work through the [chapter on variables, conditionals and loops](https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/01-variables-conditionals-loops/introduction/main.html).
- Start to think about ideas for your python library.
