In class today we spoke about group coursework an I showed you two examples of past projects.

You can see a recording of this [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=262587de-c824-4b5b-a7d0-b27800c662a1)

I spoke at length about what you are required to submit and when we will cover these aspects of the course.

After this I worked through an example of using functions and data structues to check the following identity:

$$(a + b) ^ n = \sum_{i=0}^n\binom{n}{i} a ^ i b ^ {n - i}$$

You can find a notebook with all this [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/functions-and-data-structures.ipynb)

In your groups I would expect you to now:

1. Identify a regular time in your timetable to meet each week.
2. Use your first meeting to discuss ideas for your project.
3. Work through [this chapter](https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/02-functions-and-data-structures/introduction/main.html) of Python for Mathematics.
