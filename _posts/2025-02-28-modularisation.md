On Tuesday we discussed modularisation.

You can see a recording of [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8c87bb31-f0ec-4f9d-a536-b28d00c66c39)

I started using writing modular code for the `tsp` library: a library to solve
the travelling sales agent problem.

You can find the notebook I used
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2024-2025/modularisation.ipynb)

You can see other examples in the python for mathematics text.

What I did not quite have time to do is put all the code we wrote in to a
`tsp.py` file and then import it in a Jupyter notebook to use it. You can see
more examples of doing this in the python for mathematics chapter and I'll go
over it next Friday before we start talking about documentation.
