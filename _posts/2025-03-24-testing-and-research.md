On Friday the subject librarian Cathy Parker took our class to discuss
research, sources and plagiarism. I had also not written a summary of the
previous class on testing so I'll summarise that here.

## Finding sources for your work

You can see a recording of the session lead by Cathy Parker [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=22805be5-18b0-442d-be6e-b2a200d6beca).

Cathy covered the following topics:

- How the session is relevant to the coursework
- Using good quality information, journal articles, what journal articles are
- Where to find journal articles, mentioned LibrarySearch, Google Scholar and Elicit
- Gen AI tools, how to use with academic integrity, potential uses, examples of tools, limitations and concerns
- Examples of plagiarism
- Citing and referencing - generating BibTeX files, using these in LaTeX
- Signposting to support - tutorials on academic writing, group work, giving presentations. Also stressed to contact me if they have questions.

## Testing

You can see the class on test [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=80582424-7769-4d86-9123-b29b00d6c587).

In that class we wrote `test_tsp.py` for the `tsp` library.
