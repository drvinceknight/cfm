On Friday I gave you an example of a paper, showed you how to use LaTeX
(required to write the paper) and also spoke about presentations.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1cdda44d-32d5-4635-a09f-b2a900c658d3)

You can find the example paper [here](https://vknight.org/cfm/assets/pdf/ertai_paper/main.pdf).

You can find the notes for using LaTeX [here](https://vknight.org/tex/).

You can find the principles of presentation [here](https://vknight.org/pop/).
