On Friday I gave you a further example of all that is required for the software
aspect of your project.

You can see a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0551da62-8133-4375-88d1-b2b000b5d1da)

In class I built a small library for Bayes' theorem. You can find each of the 3
files below:

- [bayes.py]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/examples/bayes/bayes.py).
- [test_bayes.py]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/examples/bayes/test_bayes.py).
- [README.md]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/examples/bayes/README.md).

As I mentioned in the class there would be ways to extend the library (it is
quite a minimalistic example so that I could do it in an hour).

Furthermore this would not be a complete submission for your project as you are
also required to submit:

- A recording of your presentation.
- The source file and the pdf of your paper.
- A contributions.md file.
