In this post I will discuss the performance of the class for the group
coursework.

A summary of the overall class performance is given here:

```txt
count    230.000
mean      65.670
std       23.649
min        0.000
25%       58.000
50%       68.000
75%       80.000
max      100.000
```

You can see the distribution of marks here:

The average and median are in line with expectations and reflect the hard work
put in a by a large portion of the class. I really enjoyed watching the
presentations and reading through your submissions. Thank you for your hard work.

You can see a list of the projects
this year [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assessment/#past-group-projects).

Two particular highlights for me:

- One of the projects probably gave the best presentation I have seen (I have been
  doing student presentations as part of my assessment for more than 10 years).
- One of the projects went up and above the expectations of the assessment in
  terms of mathematical exploration and rigour. A truly impressive piece of work
  for 1st year mathematics students (arguably for 4th year mathematics students as
  well)

I believe I have written detailed feedback on each of your projects but again: I
welcome any conversation you would like to have so please get in touch with me.

Thanks again for all the effort you put into this assessment.
