In class today we spoke about the coursework and I showed some concepts related
to the [first chapter of the part of the book we're following this week](https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/01-variables-conditionals-loops/introduction/main.html#).

You can see a recording of this here: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9e3ddf0f-db5a-4238-bb89-b3e400d6c431](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9e3ddf0f-db5a-4238-bb89-b3e400d6c431)

We spoke about the coursework:

- You can start working on this now,
- You can find an expected timeline of progress on the class site (right now you
should be working to form your groups),
- You cannot use code generation tools (chatGPT etc...)

I also started covering some basic loops using some of the content that you saw
during the first Semester. **You should work through the content of the first
chapter of the Building Tools part of the text book.**

You can find:

- The Jupyter notebook I used in class [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2025-2026/variables.ipynb)
- The notes I wrote in class [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/boards/2025-2026/variables.pdf)
