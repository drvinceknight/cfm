In class today we sang happy birthday to Adam, looked at a project presentation
from last year nd I covered some of 
the [second chapter of the part of the book](https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/02-functions-and-data-structures/introduction/main.html).

You can see a recording of this here: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f7beb67c-78de-4630-aa6a-b3eb00d6c33e](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f7beb67c-78de-4630-aa6a-b3eb00d6c33e)

In class I tried to answer questions you have about the group work this
Semester. I hope I emphasised that you should:

- Schedule weekly meetings with your groups;
- In one of those meetings I would work through the chapter of that week (watch the
recording of me going through it, work through the exercises etc...)
