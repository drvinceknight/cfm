In class today I showed you a presentation on [FractPy](https://fractpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and discussed
the [third chapter of the part of the book we're using](https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/03-objects/introduction/main.html).

You can see a recording of this here: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7e0424e5-4c25-4a58-a1a1-b3f200d6c09a](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7e0424e5-4c25-4a58-a1a1-b3f200d6c09a)

You can find:

- The Jupyter notebook I used in class [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nbs/2025-2026/objects.ipynb). I have added a number of details showing what you can do with objects.
- The board I wrote on [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/boards/2025-2026/objects.pdf)
