# Computing for Mathematics: Introduction to the course

This course will follow 3 mains texts:

1. A book covering the use of a programming language called Python:
   [vknight.org/pfm/](https://vknight.org/pfm/)
2. A set of short tutorials showing how to use the mathematical typesetting
   language LaTeX: [vknight.org/tex/](https://vknight.org/tex/)
3. A document with guidelines for writing mathematics.

All course materials are available online at
[vknight.org/cfm/](http://vknight.org/cfm/). You can also find all the source
files that create that website at
[github.com/drvinceknight/cfm/](https://github.com/drvinceknight/cfm/).

## Virtual board

I will use a virtual board throughout class:

- This will allow you to see the board more clearly on the class recordings.
- Private access will allow you to write on the board if you want to.

## In class activities

In class we will not follow the class text: these are there for you to read on
your own time. Instead we will use activities and other examples to illustrate
the concepts. I have my own notes for those (which are also available to you):
[github.com/drvinceknight/gt/do](https://github.com/drvinceknight/gt/tree/main/do)

If you would like some information about the pedagogic approach:

- You can find my "teaching philosophy" here: [vknight.org/tch-phi/](https://vknight.org/tch-phi/)
- Here is a paper describing some of the pedagogic rational for this approach: [journals.gre.ac.uk/index.php/msor/article/view/254/254](https://journals.gre.ac.uk/index.php/msor/article/view/254/254)

It is possible that the course notes will change: **for things like typos and
clarifications**, all of the notes are hosted openly on github and if you're
interested you can find a list of all changes here:
[github.com/drvinceknight/gt/commits/main](https://github.com/drvinceknight/gt/commits/main)

## Technology in class

Please use whatever resources you need to be successful in this class. Let me
know if I can help with anything.

## Office hours

I will hold 2-3 hours a week for office hours during which you may come and get
help. Specific hours will be determined collaboratively as a class.

## Kindness

In this course every participant (including myself) will be having many
interactions with other participants. Some potential examples of this:

- Peer to peer discussions during classes;
- Me explaining a given topic.

I expect **every participant** (including myself) to act with kindness
during these interactions.

Some examples of how this applies to me:

- When a student is late or absent at a class **I** will assume they
  have good reasons. If this happens regularly
  1.  I will first be concerned for their well-being.
  2.  Ask how **I** can help them catch up.
- If a student asks for an explanation of a topic that has been
  covered multiples times **I** will assume that some set of
  circumstances has prevented them from seeing these explanations and:
  1.  will explain the topic.
  2.  also point them at the explanations in the course materials
      and/or class recordings. If this is a regular occurrence I might
      ask if there are any circumstances that I can help with.
- If **I** make a mistake in a class explanation and someone helpfully
  points it out. **I** will listen and thank them for pointing it out
  and either go over the mistake then and there or go over it again at
  a future meeting.

## Assessment

There are two piece of assessment in this course:

- Individual coursework (40%)
- Group coursework (60%)
