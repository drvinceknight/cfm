## Are there other resources for learning sympy?

There are a large number of resources for learning `sympy`. Not all concentrate
on the algebra that we have considered in this chapter.
Further `sympy` functionality will be covered in the next chapters

Here are some resources:

- The main `sympy` documentation: <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html>
- The scientific python lecture notes chapter on `sympy`:
  <https://scipy-lectures.org/packages/sympy.html>
- A short tutorial:
