After class email
-----------------

Send the following email after class::

    Hi all,

    A recording of today's class is available at <>.

    In this class we discussed multiple things about the class itself:

    - Course documents available here: https://vknight.org/cfm/
    - We agreed that office hours will be: <>
    - You can find my teaching philosophy here: https://vknight.org/tch-phi/

    The goal of this week is to make sure you are able to install the software
    necessary. Follow the instruction in this chapter of the course text: 
    https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/introduction/main.html

    If you are unable to follow through the tutorial and/or the exercises please
    come by the optional drop in session on Wednesday.

    Please get in touch if I can assist with anything,
    Vince


Second meeting

- Give brief review of the contents of the chapter. Do this by working through
  the tutorial and the how to section of the relevant chapter of the class.
- Ask if anyone has any questions/comments/feedback.
- Remind everyone about the resources available to them (videos both on youtube
  and LC, chapters, plan, discord etc...).
- Explain that the following things seemed to be the main ones to come up:
    1. Finding files on computer.
    2. Difference between markdown and code cell.
    3. Using brackets when doing computations.

For each of those do a small walk-through showing the concepts again.
