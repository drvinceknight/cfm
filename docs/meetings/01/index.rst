    https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/introduction/main.html

    Please get in touch if I can assist with anything,
    Vince


Second meeting
--------------

- Give brief review of the contents of the chapter. Do this by browsing
  through: https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/how/main.html
- Ask if anyone has any questions/comments/feedback.
- Remind everyone about the resources available to them (videos both on youtube
  and LC, chapters, plan, discord etc...).
- Explain that the following things seemed to be the main ones to come up:
    1. Finding files on computer.
