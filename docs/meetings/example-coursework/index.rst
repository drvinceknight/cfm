Example coursework
==================

First meeting
-------------

After this meeting students should:

- Understand how the individual coursework will look.

In class
********

Download and show students this notebook :download:`assignment.ipynb </_static/example-coursework/assignment.ipynb>`

Could be beneficial to show students how to download and open it (from the
this page of notes). This is a task
that is often difficult. Point students at: https://vknight.org/cfm/#how-to-download-the-coursework
and here is a video showing how to do it as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpDtq589P8w

Work through the example coursework.

Second meeting
--------------

Ask students to download the mock (from the class site) and offer to demo how to
do it.

Then take any questions.
