    Office hours: ?

First **group exercise**: in groups (of approximately 4) take 5 minutes to look
at your teaching timetable and identify possible times for office hours.

**Have a discussion and set the office hours.**

Explain that we will now start talking about the course itself.

Second **group exercise**: in groups take 5 minutes to try and answer the
question: **what is programming?**.

Discuss answers together.

Third **group exercise**: in groups take 5 minutes to try and answer the
question: **why do mathematicians need to learn programming?**

Discuss answers together. Include examples like:

- Proving theorems;
- Obtaining conjectures;
- Implementing tools.

Explain that we will now start to look at the course site:

- Show the lab sheets: mention Jupyter.
- Show the documentation.
- Show the teaching philosophy.
- Mention class recording.

Discuss technology in class.

    Please use whatever resources you need to be successful in this class. Let
    me know if I can help with anything.

    In class activities will often involve you writing some code: if you have a
    laptop you can use it but it is not required.

Discuss class expectations:

- Every week: 1 class meeting to look ahead and motivate concepts.
- Every week: 1 lab session to gain feedback on understanding.
- Every week: 1 class meeting to revisit concepts and clear up
  misunderstandings.

Show and/or draw something like: :download:`schedule
<../../../_static/week_structure/main.pdf>`

Highlight the importance of personal work which ensures contact time is most useful.

Discuss difficulty and being comfortable with being uncomfortable. Show and/or draw something like
:download:`understanding <../../../_static/understanding/main.pdf>`

Point at https://vknight.org/tch-phi/

Discuss Assessment: explain that there is time at the end of the class to work
on it.

**As a group discuss hand in date.**

Show some past feedback: :download:`past feedback
<../../../../assets/pdf/past-feedback/2017-2018/main.pdf>`

Finally, discuss the goal of this week which is just to install Jupyter.

- Demo Jupyter on computer;
- Show download instructions;
- Highlight that I recommend students using their own computers (but that this
  is not necessary).

Any questions?
