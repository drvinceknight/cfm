Post: Reactive discussion + peer exercise
=========================================

Discuss with students what we have seen this week:

- Recursion
- Reading and writing from file

Ask students to go over the corresponding topics in the list of topics. With
their neighbour discuss the expected output, the code itself and ask them to
write their own examples.
