Lab: Overview of Python libraries
=================================

Outcome: agree on code base to use.

The goal of this lab session is to agree on a choice of programming approach.

Students should still work through the final chapter of the course (an overview
of a number of libraries) but the main outcome of the session should be a
conversation with the tutor and an agreement on a course of action.

    Dear students,

    The goal of the next lab session is to identify the research project you
    would like to tackle for your individual assessment <url>.

    You should aim to work through the chapter of the course demonstrating a
    number of Python libraries available to you: <>.

    Your lab tutor will aim to have a conversation with you about the specific
    project you plan to tackle. To make this conversation productive try and
    have an idea of this before the lab session. The outcome of your
    conversation should be an agreed set of programming concepts to consider for
    your topic.

    Your lab tutor will also remind you to identify at least 2 references
    relevant to your topic choice and to bring these to the next class meeting
    for discussion.

    Thanks,
    Vince
