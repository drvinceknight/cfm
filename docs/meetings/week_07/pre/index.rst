Pre: Demo of libraries
======================

Explain that this week is about identifying a research topic and corresponding
programming strategies.

At the post lab meeting we will have a research skills session with the
Librarian. This is important: it's in the marking criteria. **For that meeting,
identify at least 2 references relevant to your topic and bring them for
discussion.**

Print out copies of the following and discuss. Work through relevant notebooks.
