For Tutors
==========

The role of lab tutors is vital to the success of this course.

Records for each student are to be kept on copies of :download:`record.pdf
<../_static/record/main.pdf>` which will be used in the final marking of their
coursework.

During each lab session, the :code:`record.pdf` document should assist with:

- Speak to each student; making a note of their attendance.
- During the first 6 weeks: assist where necessary.
- From week 7 onwards: engage in discussions to help scaffold progress of students'
  coursework.

Throughout: feedback specific and/or general difficulties to Vince Knight.

After week 10: return the filled in copies of :code:`record.pdf` to Vince Knight.

Guidance
--------

- With code queries: point students at section of notes where the answer is and
  then tell them what is needed.
- With writing queries: ask them relevant questions (refer them to marking
  criteria etc...).
- Make an effort to ensure you are fair and not advantaging a given student.
- Aim to be encouraging and enthusiastic.

FAQ
---

It is possible that some students might not have the same version of the library
as used in the notes. This is unlikely to be the source of bugs (as they are
likely to have versions of the library that are backwards compatible) but you
can compare the version they are using (for example by running:
:code:`np.__version__`) to the list of libraries available here:
