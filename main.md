# Syllabus and timeline

This course will follow 3 mains texts:

1. A book covering the use of a programming language called Python:
   [vknight.org/pfm/](https://vknight.org/pfm/)
2. A set of short tutorials showing how to use the mathematical typesetting
   language LaTeX: [vknight.org/tex/](https://vknight.org/tex/)
3. A document with guidelines for writing mathematics.

My personal notes for things I plan on discussing during class sessions can be
found here: [vkcfm.readthedocs.io](https://vkcfm.readthedocs.io). **Note** that
you are not the intended audience for those notes (but you might still find them
helpful).

# Assessment

This course will be assessed in two parts:

- An individual coursework. You will be given a number of mathematics problems
  to solve using Python. This will be automatically marked and counts for 50% of
  the total mark for the course.
- A group coursework. Over the second semester you will work in a group to build
  a software tool to solve a type of mathematical problem of your choice. The
  work will be assessed through: A 15 minute presentation and a 2 page paper.

  This will count for 50% of the total mark for the course.

    During the agreed office hours, feel free to knock on my door or 
    send me an email or speak to me on discord.

## <a name="how-to-download-the-coursework"></a>[How to download the coursework?](./#how-to-download-the-coursework)


    1. Right click on the link to the coursework and save the file to your
       computer (make a note of where it is on your computer).
    2. **Do not double click on the file you have downloaded.** (see
       https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/why/main.html#why-can-i-not-double-click-on-a-jupyter-notebook-file
       for an explanation).
    3. Start a Jupyter notebook server (see
       https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/how/main.html#start-a-jupyter-notebook-server
       for instructions).
    4. Using the Jupyter notebook interface navigate to the notebook file you
       saved on your computer in step 1 and click on it.

## <a name="how-to-upload-the-coursework"></a>[How to upload the coursework?](./#how-to-upload-the-coursework)


    1. In learning central for computing for mathematics, you will find an
       assignment.
    2. Locate the `ipynb` file that corresponds to your coursework on your
       computer.
    3. Upload it to the assignment on learning central.

## <a name="can-I-use-concepts-learnt-elsewhere"></a>[Can I use concepts learnt elsewhere?](./#can-I-use-concepts-learnt-elsewhere)


    I do not discourage you from using concepts learnt elsewhere. In most
    materials I point at other materials. However if you want to be sure to have
    done things correctly for your assessment I recommend using the concepts
    taught in in this course.

# Kindness

In this course every participant (including myself) will be having many
interactions with other participants. Some potential examples of this:

- Peer to peer discussions during classes;
- Me explaining a given topic.

I expect **every participant** (including myself) to act with kindness during
these interactions.

Some examples of how this applies to me:

- When a student is late or absent at a class **I** will assume they have good
  reasons. If this happens regularly
    1. I will first be concerned for their well-being.
    2. Ask how **I** can help them catch up.
- If a student asks for an explanation of a topic that has been covered
  multiples times **I** will assume that some set of circumstances has prevented
  them from seeing these explanations and:
      1. will explain the topic.
      2. also point them at the explanations in the course materials and/or class
         recordings.
  If this is a regular occurrence I might ask if there are any circumstances
  that I can help with.
- If **I** make a mistake in a class explanation and someone helpfully points it
  out. **I** will listen and thank them for pointing it out and either go over
  the mistake then and there or go over it again at a future meeting.
