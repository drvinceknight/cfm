# Assessment

This course will be assessed in two parts:

- An individual coursework. You will be given a number of mathematics problems
  to solve using Python. This will be automatically marked and counts for 50% of
  the total mark for the course.
- A group coursework. Over the second semester you will work in a group to build
  a software tool to solve a type of mathematical problem of your choice. The
  group will give a presentation of their work and write short explanation.
  This will count for 50% of the total mark for the course.

# Contact details

- My email address is `knightva@cardiff.ac.uk`.
- I will be sending invitations to a discord server (a messaging application).

You are welcome to get in touch with me at any time although I might not
immediately be available to respond.

**As a class** we will identify some hours a week for "office hours" during
which I will be available.

# Kindness

In this course every participant (including myself) will be having many
interactions with other participants. Some potential examples of this:

- Peer to peer discussions during classes;
- Me explaining a given topic.

I expect **every participant** (including myself) to act with kindness during
these interactions.

Some examples of how this applies to me:

- When a student is late or absent at a class **I** will assume they have good
  reasons. If this happens regularly I first be concerned for
  their well-being and second ask how **I** can help them catch up.
- If a student asks for an explanation of a topic that has been covered
  multiples times **I** will assume that some set of circumstances has prevented
  them from seeing these explanations and:
  1. will explain the topic.
  2. also point them at the explanations in the course materials and/or class
     recordings.
  If this is a regular occurrence I might ask if there are any circumstances
  that I can help with.
- If **I** make a mistake in a class explanation and someone helpfully points it
  out. **I** will listen and thank them for pointing it out and either go over
  the mistake then and there or go over it again at a future meeting.
