## Algebra

### Introduction

As of 2020, the A-level syllabus includes Algebra which
https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/415060-2020-2022-syllabus.pdf
describes as:

> Algebra: this is an essential tool which supports and expresses mathematical
> reasoning and provides a means to generalise across a number of contexts.

In practice this often means:

- Manipulating numeric expressions;
- Manipulating symbolic expressions;
- Solving equations.

We can use a computer to carry out some of these techniques.

## Tutorial

To demonstrate the ways in which we can use a computer to assist with Algebra we
will solve the following two problems:

---

1. Rationalise the denominator of \\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1}\\)
2. Consider the quadratic: \\(f(x)=2x ^ 2 + x + 1\\):
  1. Calculate the descriminant of the quadratic equation \\(2x ^ 2 + x + 1 =
     0\\). What does this tell us about the solutions to the equation? What
     does this tell us about the graph of \\(f(x)\\)?
  2. By completing the square, show that the minimum point of \\(f(x)\\) is
     \\(\left(-\frac{1}{4}, \frac{7}{8}\right)\\)

---

To do this we will be using a specific collections of tools available in Python.
Often specific sets of tools are separated in to things called **libraries**. We
start by telling Python that we want to use the specific library for **symbolic
mathematics**:

```python
import sympy
```

This allows us to solve the first part of the question. First we create a variable `expression` and **assign** it a value of \\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1}\\).

```python
expression = 1 / (sympy.sqrt(2) + 1)
expression
```


**Note** that this is not what would happen if we plugged the above in to a basic calculator, it would instead give us a value of:

```python
float(expression)
```

The `sympy` library has a diverse set of tools available, one of which is to
algorithmically attempt to simplify an expression. Here is how we do that:

```python
sympy.simplify(expression)
```

This implies that:

\\[
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1} = -1 + \sqrt{2}
\\]

If we multiply both sides by \\({\sqrt{2} + 1}\\) we get:

\\[
    1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1}\times \left(\sqrt{2} + 1\right) = \left(-1 + \sqrt{2}\right)\times \left(\sqrt{2} + 1\right)
\\]

The `sympy.simplify` command did not give us much insight in to what happened but we can further confirm that above manipulation by expanding \\(\left(-1 + \sqrt{2}\right)\times \left(\sqrt{2} + 1\right)\\). 

Here is how we do that:

```python
sympy.expand((-1 + sympy.sqrt(2)) * (1 + sympy.sqrt(2)))
```

We see that `sympy` allows us to carry out basic expression manipulation. We will now consider the second part of the question:


---

2. Consider the quadratic: \\(f(x)=2x ^ 2 + x + 1\\):
  1. Calculate the descriminant of the quadratic equation \\(2x ^ 2 + x + 1 =
     0\\). What does this tell us about the solutions to the equation? What
     does this tell us about the graph of \\(f(x)\\)?
  2. By completing the square, show that the minimum point of \\(f(x)\\) is
     \\(\left(-\frac{1}{4}, \frac{7}{8}\right)\\)

---

We will start by reassigning the value of the variable `expression` to be the expression: \\(2x ^ 2 + x + 1\\).
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
x = sympy.Symbol("x")
expression = 2 * x ** 2 + x + 1
expression
```

**Recall** that the `**` symbol is how we communicate exponentiation.

**Note** we start by communicating to the code that `x` is going to be a symbolic variable.

We can immediately use this to compute the discriminant:

```python
sympy.discriminant(expression)
```

Now we can complement this with our mathematical knowledge: if a quadratic has a negative descriminant then it does not have any roots and all the values are of the same sign as the coefficient of \\(x ^ 2 \\). Which in this case is \\(2>0\\).

We can confirm this by directly creating the equation. We do this by creating a variable `equation` and assigning it the equation which has a `lhs` and a `rhs`:

```python
equation = sympy.Eq(lhs=expression, rhs=0)
equation
```

and asking Sympy to solve it:

```python
sympy.solveset(equation)
```

Indeed the only solutions are imaginary numbers: the graph of \\(f(x)\\) is thus a convex parabola.

Let us know complete the square so that we can write:

\\[
    f(x) = a (x - b) ^ 2 + c
\\]

for some values of \\(a, b, c\\).

First let us create variables that have those 3 constants as value but also create a variable `completed_square` and assign it the general expression:

```python
a, b, c = sympy.Symbol("a"), sympy.Symbol("b"), sympy.Symbol("c")
completed_square = a * (x - b) ** 2 + c
completed_square
```

We can expand this:

```python
sympy.expand(completed_square)
```

We will now use sympy to solve the various equations that arise from comparing the coefficients of:

\\[
    f(x) = 2x ^2 + x + 1
\\]

with the completed square.

First, we see that the coefficient of \\(x ^ 2\\) gives us a simple equation:

\\[
    a = 2
\\]

For completeness we will write the code that solves this trivial equation:

```python
equation = sympy.Eq(a, 2)
sympy.solveset(equation, a)
```

We will now substitute this value of \\(a\\) in to the completed square and update the variable with the new value:

```python
completed_square = completed_square.subs({a: 2})
completed_square
```

**Note** the different types of brackets being used there: both `()` and `{}`. This is important and has specific meaning in Python which we will cover soon.

Now let us look at the expression with our two remaining constants:

```python
sympy.expand(completed_square)
```

Comparing the coefficients of \\(x\\) we have the equation:
    
\\[
  - 4 b = 1  
\\]

```python
equation = sympy.Eq(-4 * b, 1)
sympy.solveset(equation, b)
```

We will now substitute this value of \\(b\\) back in to our expression.

**Note** that we make a point to tell sympy to treat \\(1 / 4\\) symbolically and to not calculate the numeric value:

```python
completed_square = completed_square.subs({b: -1 / sympy.S(4)})
completed_square
```

Expanding this to see our expression with the one remaining constant gives:

```python
sympy.expand(completed_square)
```

We have a final equation for the constant term:

\\[
    c + 1 / 8 = 1
\\]

We will use sympy to find the value of \\(c\\):

```python
sympy.solveset(sympy.Eq(c + sympy.S(1) / 8, 1), c)
```

As before we will substitute that in and update the value of `completed_square`:

```python
completed_square = completed_square.subs({c: 7 / sympy.S(8)})
completed_square
```

Using this we can see that the there are indeed no values of \\(x\\) which give negative values of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(f(x)\\) is a square added to a constant.

The minimum is clearly when \\(x=-1/4\\) which gives: \\(f(-1/4)=7/8\\):

```python
completed_square.subs({x: -1 / sympy.S(4)})
```
